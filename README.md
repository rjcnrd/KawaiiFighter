## Introduction

Kawaii Fighter is a simple game in JS. Kawaii is Japanese for cute and the game Kawaii Fighter is a play on contemporary retro design with elements of pop culture - such as rainbow colored bullets. 

### Motivation

First try to build a game after two weeks of web development experience. My goal was to build a game that uses object oriented programming with JS and canvas, including intuitive design and user interaction. 


### Features

* multiple levels based on score threshholds 
* all images created by myself in pixelart style 
* 8 bit sound effects 

###Tech/framework used

HTML - Canvas, Javascript.
